"""
Fixed-point ffLDL* / LDL* on a 2x2 Gram matrix of FFT-domain FxC polys.

Mirrors the reference `ldl_fft` / `ffldl_fft` but operates on FxR/FxC.

Three tricks over the textbook LDL formulas:

1. D_11 = G_11 − adj(L_10)·G_10  instead of  G_11 − |L_10|²·G_00.
   Mathematically equivalent (via L_10·G_00 = G_10), but avoids squaring
   L_10, which would inflate intermediate m at the root where m_L10 is
   large.
2. At the NTRU root, det(G) = q² by symplecticity, so D_11 = q²/D_00
   directly — skips the catastrophic subtraction G_11 − |L_10|²·G_00
   where G_11 ~ γ_FG² ≫ D_11. See `ldl_fft_fxp_ntru_root`.
3. Renormalize D_ii to (m_D, p) between levels so m doesn't drift up
   across the recursion. Lemma 9 guarantees D_ii fits uniformly in m_D.

All magnitude budgets (M_D, M_L10_ROOT, M_L10_INNER, M_NORM_OUT) are fixed
constants defined with their derivations in `m_budgets`; the fxp pipeline
runs only on keys passing the full NTRUGen filter, so no fallback is needed.
